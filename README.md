# Adversarial Neural Cryptography in [Tensorflow](https://github.com/keras)

A Quantum Tensorflow implementation of Google Brain's recent paper ([Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06918v1.pdf))

Two Neural Networks, Alice and Bob learn to communicate secretly with each other, in presence of an adversary Eve.
